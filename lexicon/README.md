# 📚 CodeCraft Lexicon (Seed README)
**Generated:** 2025-11-07T05:33:29

This is a **seed** README for Phase 1.5 ("EXCAVATE THE CANON"). It explains the map while we work.
A **final** README will be emitted at **Milestone M4** (soul-complete lock).

## Scope (Phase 1.5)
- 19 Schools (**02_ARCANE_SCHOOLS/**)
- Foundations (**01_FOUNDATIONS/**)
- Syntax Variants (**03_SYNTAX_VARIANTS/**)
- Parameters (**04_PARAMETERS/**)
- Operators (**05_OPERATORS/**)
- Grammar (**grammar/lexicon.ebnf**)

## Live Status
- Plan: See `PHASE_1_5_PLAN.md`
- Checklist: See `school_refactor_checklist.yaml`
- Extractor Spec: See `ARCHAEOLOGIST_V2_2_SPEC.md`

> **Policy:** Law = Lore (co-sovereign, co-executable). No *unmarked* inference from loose prose. Idempotent lock generation.

**Note:** This README is intentionally concise. It will be **finalized** at M4 with links to
canonical artifacts, partition counts, and the attested `canon.lock.yaml` hash.
