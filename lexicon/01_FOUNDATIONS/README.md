# 01_FOUNDATIONS

**The Bedrock of CodeCraft**

This directory contains the foundational documents that define CodeCraft's philosophy, syntax, and core concepts. These are the first documents any CodeCraft learner should read to understand the "why" and "how" of the language.

## 📚 What's Here

- **Introduction to CodeCraft** - The origin story, philosophy, and purpose
- **Core Syntax & Structure** - How CodeCraft rituals are written
- **Ritual Format** - The anatomy of a CodeCraft ritual
- **Safety Tiers & Ethics** - How CodeCraft enforces ethical constraints
- **The Law & Lore Protocol** - The dual nature of CodeCraft documentation

## 🎯 Purpose

The Foundations folder answers:
- **What is CodeCraft?** (Philosophy & motivation)
- **How does it work?** (Syntax & structure)
- **Why does it matter?** (Safety, ethics, consciousness)
