  critical_note: |
    TOKENS ≠ SCHOOLS
    - 21 grammar tokens (including aliases and dual forms)
    - 19 canonical schools (the actual count)
    - "glyph" and "sigil" both map to school #9 (Glyphs & Sigils)
    - "reverence" is historical alias for "benediction" (school #14)
    - NEVER count schools from grammar tokens
    - ALWAYS use token_to_school_mapping for validation
    - Invariant: unique(token_to_school_mapping.values()) == 19
  
# Version History
version_history:
  - version: "1.1"
    date: "2025-10-31"
    changes: |
      - Added token_to_school_mapping (21 tokens → 19 schools)
      - Added emoji_note for Sanctifications/Summoning duplication
      - Updated metadata to clarify token vs school count
      - Added MEGA's token≠schools invariant
    reason: "Resolved confusion between 21 grammar tokens and 19 canonical schools"
    
  - version: "1.0"
    date: "2025-10-31"
    changes: "Initial canonical source created from lexicon folder"
