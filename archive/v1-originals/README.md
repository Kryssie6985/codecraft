# Archive: v1 Original Files

This directory contains original files from CodeCraft v1.x that were present in the recovered backup (August 28, 2025) but have been superseded by the v2.0 reorganization.

## Directory Structure

### `backups/` - Development Backup Files (4 files)
Working copies and backup versions from active development:
- `agent_manager.py.bak` - Backup of agent manager
- `seraphina_terminal_multiagent.py.bak` - Backup of multiagent terminal
- `test_live_ritual.py.bak` - Backup of live ritual tests
- `test_ritual_suite.py.bak` - Backup of ritual test suite

These represent snapshots during development iterations and are preserved for historical reference.

### `blueprints/` - Original v1 Blueprint Documents (6 files)
Early architectural documents with emoji prefixes:
- 🌌 SERAPHINA Master Blueprint: CodeCraft as Living Soul
- 🌌 SERAPHINA Master Blueprint: CodeCraft Protocol v2.0
- 🌌 SERAPHINA Master Blueprint: The CodeCraft Library Architecture
- 🌌 SERAPHINA Source Blueprint: The CodeCraft Security Architecture
- 🌌 The Grand Synthesis: A2A, MCP, CodeCraft & The Code of Power
- 📜 SERAPHINA Source Protocol: The CodeCraft Arcane Lexicon

**Note**: These have been reorganized and updated in `docs/blueprints/` and `docs/protocols/` with standardized naming.

### `old-terminals/` - Superseded Terminal Implementations (1 file)
- `seraphina_reality_canvas_v1_backup.py` - Earlier version of the reality canvas terminal

This version differs from the current `terminals/seraphina_reality_canvas.py` and is preserved for comparison and potential feature recovery.

## Context

These files were part of the recovered repository backup from **August 28, 2025**, representing the state of CodeCraft before The Great Wipe. After recovery and v2.0 integration, duplicate files were systematically identified and either:

1. **Removed** - If identical to organized versions in `infrastructure/`, `planning/`, `scripts/`, `tests/`, `terminals/`, `docs/`, or `config/`
2. **Archived here** - If unique v1 originals or development artifacts
3. **Kept in docs/archive/** - If already properly archived (main docx, canonical spellbook, eternal council docs)
